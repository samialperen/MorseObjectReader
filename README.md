# MorseObjectReader

Copy this files into your toaster/pdg directory.

If your toaster version is different than directory names or locations can be different. Therefore, keeping
original files would be a good idea. Moreover, if the version is different, then do not copy "main.cpp". You
should only copy the lines that contain "MorseObject ..." to your different main.cpp
